# FFMPEG-Youtube-dl-Batch Menu
Ugh, what's that command again?!  It's painful to look up ffmpeg and youtube-dl commands, so this tool does all the common stuff for you!
(This is a personal project, and not everything works.  This is just something I dabble with when I'm bored.)

# List of features:

- Download Video
    - Choose to either download a single file or download seperate video + audio files
    - When choosing seperate video + audio files, it will combine them into one mp4 with the chosen video and audio tracks

- Download Playlist

- Split Video into Images

- Webm to MP4

- Split MKV

- MKV to MP4

- Concat mkv files

- Images to Video

# Usage:

For (most) options that require a file name, you can enter `all` and it will do all files of that file type in the same direcory.

# Notes:

Make sure you have both ffmpeg.exe and youtube-dl.exe in the same directory as the batch file.

I have a copy FFMPEG and Youtube-DL in this repository just because it is convenient.
